  /* This template uses a div with an id of "nav" for the navigation, 
  and a div with an id of "content" for the content. Each section of
  content is contained within its own div with a unique id 
  (e.g. "section1", "section2", etc.). The navigation links use the href attribute 
  to link to the corresponding section within the "content" div.

  To divide the screen down the middle, you can use CSS to set the width of 
  the "nav" and "content" divs to 50% and float them next to each other. 

  For the hover effect, you can use CSS to change the background color of the 
  links when the user hovers over them.
